title: 'Open Data and APIs Mean Nothing If You Do Nothing With It'

<p>None of this open data and APIs mean anything if we cannot actually do something with it. I have the data here, it has been liberated and evolved beyond the spreadsheets the OMB and White House published. What now? This is just the beginning...</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Next up for this project, is to start building D3.js visualizations that tell the story. I will start with some really basic ones, but then I'd like to work up to where I allow people to actually share their priorities on the information available here, as well as the spending stories it tells.</p>

<p>I could make a lot of assumptions about how to evolve the datasets, and APis available here, but it would mean nothing if I didn't have a end-goal in mind. The only way I can intelligently evolve this data is through crafting usable solutions, then I will come up with better API endpoints, and more meaningful parameters, and data.</p>

<p>I want to kickstart a handful of other Adopta projects before I get to work on these visualizations, but feel free to push forward any of this work on your own.</p>
